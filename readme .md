### Git Commands and Node.js Project Setup

# What Was Done in Class?

1. **Created a package.json file** using:
   ```sh
- npm init -y
   ```
2. **Updated the `package.json` file by adding our name in the `author` field.**
3. **Created a package-lock.json file** using:
   ```sh
- npm install
   ```
4. **Created a `node_modules` directory** by installing required dependencies:
   ```sh
- npm install express dotenv
   ```
5. **Created a `.gitignore` file** to exclude unnecessary files.
6. Added the following lines to `.gitignore`:
   ```
- node_modules/
- package-lock.json
   ```
7. **Created `server.js`** and previewed it using:
   ```sh
- node server.js
   ```
8. **Initialized a Git repository**:
   ```sh
- git init
   ```
9. **Saved all changes**:
   ```sh
- git add .
   ```
10. **Committed changes**:
    ```sh
- git commit -m "created nodejs project"
    ```
11. **Created a GitHub repository** and copied its link.
12. **Linked the local repository to GitHub**:
    ```sh
- git remote add origin <repo_link>
    ```
13. **Pushed the code to GitHub**:
    ```sh
- git push origin master
    ```

# What Was Learned?
- Git commands for version control
- Repository creation on GitHub
- Node.js project setup including dependencies (`express`, `dotenv`, `package.json`)

# Conclusion
*Successfully learned and practiced Git commands and Node.js project setup!*
